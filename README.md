# Hi, I'm Colan 👋

I'm a researcher and game developer focused on **procedural content generation** and **dynamic difficulty adjustment**. I build tools that make AI techniques more accessible to game developers. I also make [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@colanbiemer2758) about game development and algorithm visualization.


## Tools

**[adjust.h](https://github.com/bi3mer/adjust.h)**  
A single-header C99 library for hot-reloading hardcoded parameters at runtime. Useful for tweaking values without recompiling.

**[go-test](https://github.com/bi3mer/go-test)**  
A Go implementation of [try](https://github.com/tobi/try/tree/main).

**[Ponos](https://github.com/bi3mer/ponos)**  
A tool for building Markov Decision Processes that assemble video game levels for dynamic difficulty adjustment.

**[GDM](https://github.com/bi3mer/GDM)** · [TypeScript version](https://github.com/bi3mer/GDM-TS)  
A library for formulating MDPs as graphs, with implementations of policy iteration and other solving methods.

**[GDM-Editor](https://github.com/bi3mer/GDM-Editor)**  
A visual editor for GDM graphs.
